# Computer Vision Assignments
## National Technical University of Athens, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
### Lab assignments for the 8th semester course Computer Vision

In this course, we studied several concepts in <b>Computer Vision</b> such as:
* Image Geometry and Creation of Images
* 2D and 3D Image analysis with linear filters and Fourier Analysis (mostly Gabor filters and Wavelts) or non-linear methods.
* Multiscalar Image Analysis
* Edge and Feature Detection
* Shape Analysis
* Texture Analysis and Modeling
* Segmentation
* Detection of 2D Optical Flow and 3D Movement
* 3D Shape estimation
* Object and Action Detection

The course also has a lab with the following assignments, which were done using Matlab:
> Lab1: <br>
<t> Edge detection in noisy grayscale images <b>(Part 1)</b>, interest points detection <b>(Part 2)</b> and image classification using the BOVW (bag of visual words) concept <b>(Part 3)</b>. In Part 3, the training dataset is not provided due to its large size.
